# Class 12 Notes:

## EJS Partials:

- using partials makes html code more reusable. like moving it into a function.
- use partails on codeblocks whose html render and appear in the same view?

- make a partial by wrapping code in the following: `<%-include(filenamehere)%>` the actual HTML is stored in the seperate `filenamehere`
- see code examples on the following site: https://medium.com/@henslejoseph/ejs-partials-f6f102cb7433
