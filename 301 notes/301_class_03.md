## Templating:

- templating make for easier rendering of page layouts.
- **Mustache** is a template syntax that can be used for HTML, JS, etd.
- it is `logic-less`, meaning that there is no need for code statements like if, if-else, loops, etc.
- **Mustache** is implemented on Javascript using _mustache.js_

Example Code:

```js
Mustache.render(“Hello, {{name}}”, { name: Billy });
// returns: Hello, Sherlynn

/* The {{}} is mustache syntax called a placeholder. When Mustache compiles this, it will look for the ‘name’ property in the object, and replace {{ name }} with the actual value, “Billy”.*/
```

**NOTE:** Mustache is a specification for templating, it is NOT a templating engine.

- Can use **Mustache-Express** with Node and Express. to install with NPM, use the ling `$ npm install mustache --save`

## FlexBox:

- main idea behind flex layout = is to give the container the ability to alter an items' width/height and order to best fill available space on the screen.
- Flexbox is directionally agnostic.
- NOTE: Flex is best for small layouts, bigger layouts are better supportied using Grid.

Examples of flex properties:

```css
 {
  display: ; /*flex*/
  flex-direction: ; /*row, row reverse, column, column-revers*/
  justify-content: ; /*flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, speace-arounds*/
  align-items: ; /*flex-start, flex-end, baseline, stretch*/
}
```
