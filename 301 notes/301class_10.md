# 301 Class Notes : 10

## The Call Stack:

- A call stack - a mechanism that stores details of the functions called by the sourcecode in sequence. Each function can returns on completion to the code that calls it.
  - When a function is called, the interpreter adds it to the stack, then runs it.
  - any functions called by THAT function, are also added to the stack.
  - when a function completes, it is removed from the stack.
  - if the stack takes up too much space, it throws `stack overflow` error.

## The Jasvascript Call Stack:

- In Asynchronous JS we have4: _callback_, the _event loop_, and a _task queue_
- call stack is a **data structure**
- and a **stack** is a Last In, First Out, data structure.

## Javascript and Errors:

- Reference Error: trying to use a variable that has not been declared yet. will display as `Uncaught Reference`

- Syntax Error: self explainitory, usually mispelled code. will cast message `SyntaxError: Unexpected token 0 in json position ...`

- RangeError: trying to call manipualte an object by calling on an invalid index or incorrect length of the object. will cast message like `// Uncaught RangeError: Invalid array`
