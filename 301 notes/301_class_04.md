# Class 04:

## Grid:

- Grid Properties:

  - `grid-template-columns: 25% 25% 25% 25%` - sets up 4 columns
  - `grid-template-rows: 25% 25% 25% 25%;` - sets up 4 rows;
  - `grid-column-start: x` - element starts onto the Xth column;
  - `grid-column-end: y` - span element ends at Yth column.
  - `grid-column: x / y` - spans element spans from X to Y.

  - `grid-row-start: x` - element starts onto the Xth row;
  - `grid-row-end: y` - span element ends at Yth row.
  - `grid-row: x / y` - spans element spans from X to Y.
  - `grid-area1: a / b / x / y ` - accepts four values, representing `grid-row-start`, `grid-column-start`, `grid-row-end`, and `grid-column-end` respectivley

  **NOTE:** if grid items aren't explicitly placed with `grid-area, grid-column, grid-row,` etc., they're automatically placed based on their order in the code. this can overridden using the `order` property.

  - `order` can be positive OR negative.

## RegEx:

- **Regular Experessions:** or RegEx, are useful for extracting info from any text.
