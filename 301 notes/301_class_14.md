# Database Normalization:

Normalization: A process used to organize a database into table.

- a table should be commited to a single purpose, to avoid duplicate information being shown.
- noramlizing data also minimizes modification issues, and to simplify queries.

- Duplicated information causes two problems. it increases storage, and makes maintinance/changes more difficult.

- There are 3 different forms of normalization. 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.

1NF: The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns

2NF: The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the tableâ€™s primary key.

3NF: The table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key
