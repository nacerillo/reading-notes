# Reading Notes 7: APIs continued.

Todat we'll learn:

- how to create a named route thats sends data back and forth.
- how to turn one object into an easier to use object.

## REST

- Roy Fielding helped to build the modern internet, and the `http` protocol.
- `http` at the begining of a url tells the browser what protocol to use.
- `REST` is the architecture that the entire web is built on. http requests point to a resource, and the resources are defined by `REST`

- Through Web Services and APIS, computer can interact and share resources with eachother using web protocols.

- `Redirect`: when a machine asks another machine to retrive resources from ANOTHER machine.
- messages like that are past using `URL`

- `Poloymorphism:` A paradigm of Object Orient Programming. It refers to the idea that different _nouns_ can have the same _verb_ applied to them. `Practical Example: two methods could share the same name, but perform two different actions`. Or how _get_ and _grab_ are differnet words, but can mean the same thing.

- `GET` , `DELETE` `PUT` are universal verbs. and are all HTTP Protocal actions.
