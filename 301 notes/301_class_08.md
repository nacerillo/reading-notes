# Class 08: SQL

- **SQL(Structured Query Language):** A programming language used to allow users to query, manipulate, and transform data.
- **Relational Database:** a collection of related tables, each with a fixed number of named columns - which prepresnt properties/attributes of the table - and any number of rows - which hold the data values.

## simple SELECT

- to get data from a table, we use `SELECT` queries.

  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2 , …
  FROM mytable;
  ```

- can use `*` to select ALL data

```sql
 SELECT *
  FROM mytable;
```

## Setting Contraints

- can use `WHERE`, `AND`, and `OR` to set conditions for what data is retrieved.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, …
FROM MyTable
WHERE condition1
    AND/OR condition2
    AND/OR …;
```

- other conditional operators also exist, `BETWEEN`,`AND`,`=`,`!=`, etc
  EXAMPLE :

```sql
SELECT * FROM Films
WHERE year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2020 ;
```
