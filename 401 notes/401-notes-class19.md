3. Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

- Standard queue is at-least-once queue, and a FIFO Queue is a one-time-only queue

4. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

- `Dynamo vs Mongo`: [SOURCE](https://www.xplenty.com/blog/dynamodb-vs-mongodb-differences/#:~:text=DynamoDB%20is%20a%20fully%20managed,fully%20managed%20with%20MongoDB%20Atlas.&text=DynamoDB%20uses%20tables%2C%20items%20and,and%20has%20fewer%20size%20restrictions.):

  - MongoDB is vendor agnostic, Open Source, and can be deployed anywhere. DynamoDB is only available on AWS.
  - DynamoDB is a fully managed AWS service, MongoDB can be self installed or fully managed with MongoDB Atlas.
  - DynamoDB as an integrated AWS service makes it easier to develop end to end solutions.
  - DynamoDB uses tables, items and attributes, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents.
  - DynamoDB supports limited data types and smaller item sizes; MongoDB supports more data types and has fewer size restrictions.

- `Dynamoose vs Mongoose`:
