## Thoughts:

- A few years ago, back in 2018, Google faced heat regarding the use of its AI technology for military purposes. While the company states that their AI would never be weaponized in any way, Google still works with the U.S Military to use it's technology for things such as cybersecurity, and search-and-rescue, and any operations that dont involve the commiting of violence. I wonder if it still counts as a "conflict of public interest", for Google to maintain contracts with the U.S Military. and while they claim that, as of right now, AI technology is not being weaponized, It would not suprise me if U.S Military is already taking steps towards developing their own, or using whatever resources they might learn or gather from working with Google in order to do so.
