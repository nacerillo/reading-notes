## Thoughts:

- A few years ago, back in 2018, Google faced heat regarding the use of its AI technology for military purposes. While the company states that their AI would never be weaponized in any way, Google still works with the U.S Military to use it's technology for things such as cybersecurity, and search-and-rescue, and any operations that dont involve the commiting of violence. I wonder if it still counts as a "conflict of public interest", for Google to maintain contracts with the U.S Military. and while they claim that, as of right now, AI technology is not being weaponized, It would not suprise me if U.S Military is already taking steps towards developing their own, or using whatever resources they might learn or gather from working with Google in order to do so.

## Thoughts:

- This is one of those issues that I feel pretty strongly about. While I can see the benefit in brining some measure of automation and AI into automobiles, their are a lot of uncomfortable questions that need to be considered before we allow ourselves to **completely** trust self driving cars. The article brings one of these questions to light; how would a self-driving car decide who gets injured in an unavoidable accident? a "no-win situation" as the article puts it. to be honest,its this entire notion, the deflecting/removing of responsiblity that I think will also be a major concern. If someone is behind the wheel of a self-driving car during an accident, who would be to blame? what if there was no way to confirm whether or not an accidnet is caused by either the driver or the car? Personally, know how people these days love to shift blame in bad situations, I am not sure our society is ready to full invest in putting self-driving cars on our streets.
