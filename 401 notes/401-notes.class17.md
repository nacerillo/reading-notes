## Q and A

1. Describe the Cloud.

- the cloud is a vast collection of servers that are accessed over the internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. by using the cloud, users can access the same applications from almost any device; the storgage and computing for these applications take place in the cloud servers, instead of on a local device. the cloud is what allows the internet to function as it does.

2. What is a container?

- containers are a way of packaging that allows code and applications to be abstracted from the system that they actaully run in. [SOURCE](https://cloud.google.com/containers)

3. What is auto-scaling?

- a cloud computing technique for dynamically allocating resources to be used by an application. can automatically scale up or down depending on changes that you make to your app.[SOURCE](https://docs.rightscale.com/faq/What_is_auto-scaling.html)

4. what is Bandwidth?

- the amount of data that can be transferred across a network in a given amount of time. it is the transmission capacity of a connection.[SOURCE](https://www.paessler.com/it-explained/bandwidth)

5. How do cloud providers compute service cost?

- it is based on the cost of network hardware, infrastructure maintenance, and labor. the sum of these expense are then divided by the number of server-units a business would need for its cloud.[SOURCE](https://expedient.com/knowledgebase/blog/2015-05-01-how-the-cost-of-cloud-computing-is-calculated/#:~:text=When%20setting%20price%2C%20cloud%20providers,need%20for%20its%20IaaS%20cloud.)

## Vocab:

- `Server Instances:`
- `Containers:` ontainers are a way of packaging that allows code and applications to be abstracted from the system that they actaully run in.
- `Cloud Architecutre:` The various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, applications, etc. engineered to leverage the power of cloud resources to solve business problems. the components include...

  - on premise resources
  - cloud resources
  - sofware components/services
  - the middleware

- `AWS:` Amazon Web Services. Amazon's own cloud platform. offers scalable and inexpensive cloud computing services, such as Beaanstalk.
- `EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku:`
- `CDN:` Content Delievery Network. it is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. A CDN allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content [SOURCE](https://cyberhoot.com/cybrary/content-delivery-network-cdn/)

## Preview:

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

- i have a better undetstanding of what the cloud is, what AWS is, and how we can deploy applications to it.

2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- would like a better understanding of Beanstalk, and would like to go back over how we deploy to AWS via console commands.

3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
