# Class 35 Notes: Graphs:

**Definition:** a non-linear data structure that is made up of a finite amount of nodes/verticies connected by a finite amount of edges.

- **vertex:** the nodes of a graph, each containing both a scrap of data, and references to its neighbors.
- **edge:** a connecting point between two vertices.
- **neighbor:** a vertex that shares an edge with another vertex.
- **degree:** used to describe the number of edges that are connected to a vertex.
