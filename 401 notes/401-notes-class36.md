## Q and A:

1. What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”.

- Cookies are more secure than local storage. and cookies are automatically sent on HTTP requests.

2. Explain 3rd Party cookies?

3. How do pixel tags work?

- Pixel tags are typically single pixel, transparent GIF images that are added to a web page. Even though the pixel tag is virtually invisible, it is still served just like any other image you may see online.

## Vocab:

- `cookies`: Text files with small pieces of data — like a username and password — that are used to identify your computer as you use a computer network. Specific cookies known as HTTP cookies are used to identify specific users and improve your web browsing experience. Data stored in a cookie is created by the server upon your connection. This data is labeled with an ID unique to you and your computer. [SOURCE](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/cookies)
- `authorization`: Authorization is a process by which a server determines if the client has permission to use a resource or access a file. [SOURCE](https://www.bu.edu/tech/about/security-resources/bestpractice/auth/#:~:text=Authorization%20is%20a%20process%20by,is%20that%20is%20requesting%20access.)
- `access control`: A security practice that regulates who or what can view or use resources in a computing environment. [SOURCE](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/access-control)
- `conditional rendering`: a technique in react where components and elements only render under conditions set by the developer. these components are usually wrapped in the condtional `<If/>`, `</When>` etc components.
