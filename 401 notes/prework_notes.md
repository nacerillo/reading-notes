## How to Solve Programming Problems:

- Remember to allocate your time!
- Spend Time making sure you understand the problem!
  1. Full understand the problem
  2. Go over examples
  3. Consider edge cases
- Don’t dive into code immediately. Plan and discuss before you write real code.
- Follow these steps: (Spend 70 of your time on a-c)

  1. Read the problem completely twice.
  2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
  3. Optimize the manual steps.
  4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
  5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
  6. Optimize the real code.

- SIDENOTE: Even if you think that you have found the solution, try to consider if it can be optimized.

## Acto Like You’re Worth 1000/Hr:

- Many people waste their time on unproductive activities like **low quality television, and social media. DON’T DO THAT**.
- Treat your time like a **paycheck**. If you don’t budget it, you wont have enough of it when you need it.
- Successful people are not _busy_. Successful people are _Focused_
- As you THINK, you ARE.

## Lessons In Programming.

- Thinking like a programmer means thinking like an effective problem-solver.
- Problem solving / computational thinking is arguably the most IMPORTANT skill to have when it comes to getting a job as a developer.
- How to solve a problem:

  1. UNDERSTAND

  - Know what is being asked. (be able to explain it in plain English)
  - maybe make a diagram if itn helps

  2. PLAN

  - Give yourself time to analyze the problem.
  - Consider what steps you will need to take to get the solution
  - WRITE OUT the steps

  3. DIVIDE

  - Break down the solution into subsets.
  - Solve each step piece by piece.
  - Solve the easiest steps first.

  - if you get STUCK: - DOES NOT PAY TO PANIC - Try to debug. - try a different approach - if all else fails, research the solution.

- PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE!!!

## Five WHYS;

- Getting to the bottom of an issue by asking WHY framed questions 5 times.
- The 5 Whys uses "counter-measures," rather than "solutions." A counter-measure is an action or set of actions that seeks to prevent the problem from arising again, while a solution may just seek to deal with the symptom
- Use it to solve any kind of technical or problem-solving issue.
- Your first WHY should be about Why the problem is occurring.
- For each answer you receive from your first question, ask four more Why questions framed in the response to the previous question.
