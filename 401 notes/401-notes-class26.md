# Component Based UI:

## Q and A:

1. Name 5 javascript UI Frameworks other than react.
   - Answer: Node.js, JQuery, Vue, Express, Angular
2. What is the difference between a Framework and a Library.

   - Answer: If you wish to use a resource from a library, all you have to do is import it into your code. but if you want to use a Framework, you would have to build your entire application based on the standards of the framework. also, a Framework usually is made up of libraries.

## Vocab:

- `Rendering:` to display. To output data from the frontend onto the screen as the UI.
- `Templates:` html/markup that is seperated from the frontend logic, and made into a modular format.
- `State:` the object that stores propery values of a component. [SOURCE](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_state.asp)

## Prep-readings:

1. I learned that know more about now...

   - JSX: can let us declare html elements as javascript variables. VERY USEFUL. After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.
   - Elements: I learned that they are, in fact, IMMUTABLE. Once you create an element, you canâ€™t change its children or attributes. [SOURCE](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html)

   2. I hope that in future lectures we can
      - get more in depth with state and prop, to fully understand what they are.
      - learn more about what hooks are.
      - learn how to use bootstrap to make sleek UI.
