# Clas 15: AWS Cloud Server:

## Q and A:

1. Describe the WEb Request Response Cycle
   - The cyclic interation between a client and a server
   - a client sends requests to a server via http request. "Post, Get, Delete, Put"
   - the clients requests are sent through a body or header to the server.
   - the server will process the request details, and then fire back to the client with an appropriate response.

2. Explain what a "server" is as it relates to the WRRC.
   - a server will send back a HTTP Response. the response will contain a status code and, depending on if the request was successful, the resource that the request was made for.
3. What does it mean to "deploy" and application
   - Deploying a application means to make it available. it is the delievery of an application from its developers, to its users.
   - this involes the launching of an application onto a server or device, to create a URL that can be accessed by the intended audience. [SOURCE](https://www.sumologic.com/glossary/software-deployment/).

## VOCAB:

- `Server:` A program or device that provides functionality and/or resources to another program and/or device. aka client.
- `Publish/Subscribe:` refers to the framework for exchanging messages between publisher and subscribers. instead of sending requests directly between different moduels, publishers can publish a message out to a broker "message queue" that other modules, called the subscribers, can listen for.
