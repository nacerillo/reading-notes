# CLASS 41: React Native:

## Q and A:

1. Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”

- Redux Toolkit and Ducks are both tools used to oraganize and develope a redux application. however, Redux Toolkit refers to the entire redux library, while Ducks is a design principle.[SOURCE](https://medium.com/@matthew.holman/what-is-redux-ducks-46bcb1ad04b7)

2. What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit

- it provides you with almost everything that you will need, and will include boiler plate for setting up your reducers and actions. the disadvantage is that it will also give you alot of things that you might not need.[SOURCE](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2020/02/simplifying-redux-with-the-redux-toolkit/)

## Vocab:

- `redux toolkit slices`:functions that accepts an initial state, an object containing reducer functions, and a name - refered to as a "slice name" - that automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state. [SOURCE](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createSlice)
- `namespace`: A container for a set of identifiers, functions, and methods, etc. wrapping all of these things into a single umbrella that can be called on and used in another location. [SOURCE](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/829254/JavaScript-Namespace)
