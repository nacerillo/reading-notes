# Class-04 Notes:

1. What are three advantages of Test Driven Development.
   - control over the success constraints of your code.
   - improves debugging of your code.
   - makes code easier to refactor.
2. In what case would you need to use `beforeEach()` or `afterEach()` in a test suite?

   - you can use `beforeEach()` and `afterEach()` to run functions directly before or after - respectively - each test block.

3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development?

   - time consuming.

4. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
   - A class defines a type, which can be instantiated at a runtime, and used to create an object. A prototype is itself an object instance.
5. Why Rest?

## Vocab:

- `functional programming`: A programming paradigm focuses on binding and organzing of code in purley functions and math.
- `object-oriented programming (OOP)` - A programming paradigm that focuses on the use of classes and objects to create code. OOP modular, and follows four major principles. [From Eduactive](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming#four)
  - `Inheritance:` child classes inherit data and behaviors from parent class
  - `Encapsulation:` containing information in an object, exposing only selected information
  - `Abstraction:` only exposing high level public methods for accessing an object
  - `Polymorphism:` many methods can do the same task
- `class` - a template from which we can create objects, providing values for state and implementing behavior.
- `super` - a keyword in javascript that is used to access and call functions on an object's parent. [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/super)
- `this` - a keyword in javascript that is used for binding. it usually referes to the object that it "belopngs" to.
- `Test Driven Development (TDD)` - Beginning you code development process by makings the test for your code first, and establishing your success criteria
- `Jest` - a javascript testing framework.
- `Continuous Integration (CI)`
- `REST` - Representational State Transferx
- `Data Model`
