1. What are serverless functions?

- functions that are hosted on a managed infrastructure. they are usually single use, and are invoked through the web.

2. If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?

- would create on by using AWS to zip and upload a pre-written function onto the cloud. that being said, i am still trying to figure out how to write a working function.

3. Describe how a CDN works

- The shorter the distance between requestor and responder, the better the latency. CDNs store chached versions of website content in multiple locations across the world. these locations are called "points of presence". devices called "user agents" are then used to request conent from these servers on behalf of actual users.
